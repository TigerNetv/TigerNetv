###ğŸ”­ Welcome home, my friend. 

Thanks for accidentally stumbling upon my small stake of the Internet; I'm happy you're here.
As it turns out, this is not only my home â€” but yours too.

##I am a freelancer.
That means that I take advantage of the Internet to make money off of people (just kidding ğŸ˜„).

##I am a Programmer & Penetration Tester.
You can check out my codes here [Python, C#, C++, Java, Ruby, GO]
